INTRODUCTION
============
	
	This is an OpenGL application written using C++ and glut to demonstrate 
	differnt operations on 3D models.
	
	* Features supported
	  ------------------
	  
		- Loading of any 3D model from ply file(Simple Ply format with 
		  triangle support)
		- Rotation of 3D Model using keyboard
		- Rotation of 3D Model using virtual trackball
		- Scaling
		- Translation
		- Zooming(Using Camera movement)
		- Lighting


HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN
======================
	
	- Compile in non-debug mode	  
	  $make
	- Compile in debug mode
	  $make CFLAGS='-D DEBUG'
	  
	This will generate an executable 'main' in same directory
	Execute bellow command to run
	$./main [Plyfilename]

INPUT
=====
	This application takes 3D model described in simple plyfile as input.
	Defalut filename is "input.ply", which should be present in same 
	directory as of main
