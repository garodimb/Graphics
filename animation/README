INTRODUCTION
============

	This is an OpenGL application written using C++ and glut to demonstrate
	animation using scenegraph

	* Features supported
	  ------------------
		- Moving train with Cow and Ant on top of it
		- Moving train without Cow and Ant after detaching
		- Moving cow after detaching
		- Detach at any place
		- Cameras moving with objects
		- Change texture by clicking on images
		- Object selection
		- Lighting


HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN
======================

	- Compile in non-debug mode
	  $make
	- Compile in debug mode
	  $make CFLAGS='-D DEBUG' CXXFLAGS='-D DEBUG'

	This will generate an executable 'main' in same directory
	Execute bellow command to run
	$./main
