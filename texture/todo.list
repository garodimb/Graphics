1. Apply limit of translation

2. Remove unnecessary code like rotation, scaling

3. Update camera zoom in by multiplying with quaternion

4. Compute bounding box inside model class only
	Compute bounding box inside model using cube of
	x_min,y_min,z_min,x_max,y_max,z_max.
	Render with and without bounding box.
	Scaling and translating object automatically scales and translates
	bounding box(Not necessarily a cube of same size)
	Keep scale factor as it is for now

5. Organize code in good way
	Create structured way for src,include,lib,bin
