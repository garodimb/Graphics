Pending Work:
1. Automatic Vs Manual Texture mapping for objects
	Write function to control automatic and manual texture mapping.
	Automatic texture mapping function should support different types
	of maps.

2. Translation of selected object along x and z direction
	Make sure objects are not crossing boundaries of floor

3. Remove unnecessary code like rotation, scaling

4. Update camera zoom in by multiplying with quaternion

5. Camera class with following operations
	Data:
		init_pos, init_up_v, init_lookat
		curr_pos, curr_up_v, curr_lookat
	Functions:
		get and set for both
		function for placing camera(gluLookat)

6. Compute bounding box inside model class only
	Compute bounding box inside model using cube of
	x_min,y_min,z_min,x_max,y_max,z_max.
	Render with and without bounding box.
	Scaling and translating object automatically scales and translates
	bounding box(Not necessarily a cube of same size)
	Keep scale factor as it is for now

7. Organize code in good way
	Create structured way for src,include,lib,bin
